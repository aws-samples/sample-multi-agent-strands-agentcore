    "# Lab 4: Deploy Multi-Agent System to Production with AgentCore Runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will deploy your Multi-Agent Customer Support System to production using **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime** with comprehensive observability and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) is a secure, fully managed runtime that empowers organizations to deploy and scale AI agents in production, regardless of framework, protocol, or model choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done)**: Multi-Agent Foundation - Built orchestrator with specialized agents\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Done)**: Multi-Agent Memory - Added persistent memory across agents\n",
    "- **Lab 3 (Done)**: Multi-Agent Gateway - Secure tool sharing via AgentCore Gateway\n",
    "- **Lab 4 (Current)**: Multi-Agent Runtime - Deploy with observability and monitoring\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Multi-Agent Testing - Post your queries to test multi agent routing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Runtime & Production Deployment Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current State (Labs 1-3):** Multi-agent system runs locally with centralized tools but faces production challenges:\n",
    "- Agents run locally in single sessions\n",
    "- No comprehensive monitoring or debugging capabilities\n",
    "- Cannot handle multiple concurrent users reliably\n",
    "- No automatic scaling or error recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**After this lab:** Production-ready multi-agent infrastructure with:\n",
    "- Serverless auto-scaling for each agent type\n",
    "- Comprehensive observability with traces, metrics, and logging\n",
    "- Enterprise reliability with automatic error recovery\n",
    "- Secure deployment with proper access controls\n",
    "- Independent scaling of orchestrator and specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Comprehensive Observability with AgentCore Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "[AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) provides full visibility into your multi-agent system's behavior in production, including:\n",
    "- Request tracing across agent interactions\n",
    "- Performance monitoring for each agent type\n",
    "- Tool usage patterns and memory access analytics\n",
    "- Cross-agent conversation flow analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Agent Runtime Architecture for Lab 4\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents now run in AgentCore Runtime with full observability through CloudWatch. The orchestrator coordinates requests across specialized agents, each with independent scaling and monitoring. Memory and Gateway integrations from previous labs remain fully functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Deployment:** Deploy orchestrator and specialized agents independently\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Observability:** Full request tracing across agent interactions\n",
    "- **Independent Scaling:** Each agent type scales based on its specific demand\n",
    "- **Production Reliability:** Enterprise-grade error handling and recovery\n",
