    "## Lab 2: Adding Memory to Multi-Agent Customer Support System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 1, you built a multi-agent customer support system with an orchestrator and specialized agents. While this system works well for individual sessions, real-world customer support needs persistent memory to provide personalized experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run **Multi-Agent Systems in Production**, we need:\n",
    "- **Cross-Agent Memory Sharing**: Agents remember customer context across handoffs\n",
    "- **Persistent Customer Profiles**: Long-term learning about customer preferences\n",
    "- **Intelligent Routing Memory**: Orchestrator learns optimal routing patterns\n",
    "- **Technical Solution History**: Knowledge base agent remembers successful solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Progress:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done)**: Multi-Agent Foundation - Built orchestrator with specialized agents\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Current)**: Multi-Agent Memory - Add persistent memory across agents\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Multi-Agent Gateway - Secure tool sharing and identity management\n",
    "- **Lab 4**: Multi-Agent Runtime - Deploy with observability and monitoring\n",
    "- **Lab 5**: Multi-Agent Frontend - Build customer-facing application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll transform your multi-agent system from stateless interactions into an intelligent, memory-enabled system that learns and personalizes across all agents.\n",

    "## Lab 2 Summary: Multi-Agent Memory Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎉 Congratulations! \n",
    "\n",
    "You've successfully enhanced your multi-agent customer support system with persistent memory capabilities. Here's what you've accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Memory Architecture**: Created a comprehensive memory system that works across multiple specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Agent Context Sharing**: Enabled customer context and preferences to flow seamlessly between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Routing Memory**: Built an orchestrator that learns from past routing decisions to improve accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Specialized Memory Hooks**: Implemented agent-specific memory behaviors while maintaining shared customer context\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Persistent Learning**: Created a system that continuously learns and improves from customer interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Memory Capabilities Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Preferences**: System remembers customer preferences across all agent interactions\n",
    "- **Technical Solutions**: Knowledge base agent builds upon previous troubleshooting attempts\n",
    "- **Routing Intelligence**: Orchestrator learns optimal routing patterns for different query types\n",
    "- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Customer context persists across different sessions and timeframes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lab 3**, you'll add:\n",
    "- **AgentCore Gateway**: Secure tool sharing across agents\n",
    "- **Identity Management**: Multi-user support with proper isolation\n",
    "- **Advanced Security**: Role-based access control for agent tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory transforms stateless agents into intelligent, personalized assistants\n",
    "- Multi-agent systems benefit significantly from shared memory architectures\n",
    "- AgentCore Memory provides enterprise-grade persistence with minimal complexity\n",
    "- Cross-agent memory sharing enables sophisticated customer experiences\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Production Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory namespaces provide natural multi-tenancy for customer isolation\n",
    "- Long-term memory processing happens asynchronously without blocking interactions\n",
    "- Memory strategies can be customized for different business requirements\n",
    "- Cross-agent context sharing scales to complex multi-agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready for Lab 3?** Your memory-enhanced multi-agent system is now prepared for secure, scalable deployment with AgentCore Gateway!"
