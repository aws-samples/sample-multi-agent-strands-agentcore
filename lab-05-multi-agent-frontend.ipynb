    "### 🎯 What You'll See in the Frontend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chat Interface**\n",
    "   - Natural conversation with your multi-agent system\n",
    "   - Real-time responses from the orchestrator agent\n",
    "   - Message history with session persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Status Sidebar**\n",
    "   - Authentication status\n",
    "   - Agent health monitoring\n",
    "   - Architecture overview\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Demo Scenarios**\n",
    "   - **📦 Track My Order**: Customer Support Agent coordination\n",
    "   - **🔧 Technical Support**: Knowledge Base Agent integration\n",
    "   - **💰 Billing Question**: Multi-agent collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Input**: User types a question or selects a demo scenario\n",
    "2. **Authentication**: Cognito validates the session (from Lab 3 setup)\n",
    "3. **Agent Coordination**: Orchestrator agent (from Lab 4) coordinates response\n",
    "4. **Memory Integration**: Conversation context persists (from Lab 2)\n",
    "5. **Tool Access**: Agents use secure tools via Gateway (from Lab 3)\n",
